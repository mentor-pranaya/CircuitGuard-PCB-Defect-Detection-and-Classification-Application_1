Hello Ma'am 👋

I have successfully completed Milestone 4, Module 7: Testing, Evaluation, and Exporting Results this week.

Key Steps and Deliverables:

-- Complete Full-Board Testing Pipeline:
Implemented a full testing workflow that takes an entire PCB board image, finds the correct template, aligns the image, extracts defect regions (ROIs), and classifies each defect using the EfficientNet-B4 model.

-- Template Matching & Alignment:
Used ORB keypoint matching and homography to automatically identify the correct PCB template and align the uploaded board with high accuracy, even for rotated or scaled images.

-- ROI Extraction & Defect Localization:
Performed image subtraction, Otsu thresholding, and morphological filtering to automatically detect defective regions on the full PCB and extract them for classification.

-- Deep-Learning Classification:
Used the trained EfficientNet-B4 checkpoint (from Module-3) to classify every ROI with Top-1 and Top-2 predictions, along with softmax confidence scores.

-- Annotated Board Output:
Generated fully annotated PCB images showing bounding boxes around defects with color-coded labels, making it easy to visually understand defect positions.

-- Export Features (Images + Logs):
Added options to download:

Annotated PCB image

CSV log containing defect coordinates, class predictions, confidence values, and template index used

-- Streamlit-Based Final UI:
Developed a polished, dark-themed Streamlit UI where users can:

Upload a full PCB image

View aligned and annotated results

Review defect summaries

Download outputs with a single click
