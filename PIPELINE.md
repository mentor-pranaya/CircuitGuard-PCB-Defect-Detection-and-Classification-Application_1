## October 22, 2025

* **Objective:** Scaled up image processing to handle the complete PCB defect dataset.
* **Key Learnings:**
    * **Batch Implementation:** Successfully processed entire dataset of 694 test images across 6 defect categories: Short, Spur, open, mouse_bite, spurious, and missing_hole.
    * **Processing Duration:** Complete batch processing took approximately 20-30 minutes with real-time progress tracking using tqdm progress bars for each category.
    * **Organized Output Structure:** Created systematic folder hierarchy with difference_maps/ and defect_masks/ directories, each containing subfolders for all 6 defect types.
    * **100% Success Rate:** All 694 images processed successfully with alignment and thresholding working correctly for every image pair.
    * **Detailed Reporting:** Generated processing_report.json containing per-image statistics including alignment status, Otsu threshold values, and mean pixel differences.

## October 21, 2025

* **Objective:** Performed comprehensive dataset analysis and validated the complete image processing workflow on sample data.
* **Key Learnings:**
    * **Dataset Inspection First:** Conducted full dataset inventory to understand the complete dataset structure before processing.
    * **Dataset Statistics:** Documented 6 defect categories (Short, Spur, open, mouse_bite, spurious, missing_hole) totaling approximately 694 test images paired with corresponding template images.
    * **Created Inspection Report:** Generated dataset_inspection_report.json with detailed breakdown showing image counts per category, total test images, and template counts for documentation.
    * **Single Image Testing:** Validated entire pipeline using test pair to confirm each processing step works correctly before scaling to full batch.
    * **Alignment Verification:** Confirmed ORB feature-based alignment successfully registers test images to templates through visual inspection and correlation coefficient verification.
    * **Defect Visualization Success:** Verified image subtraction produces clear difference maps with defect regions appearing as bright red/yellow hot zones against dark background areas.
    * **Thresholding Validation:** Tested Otsu's automatic thresholding achieving optimal value of 65.0, producing clean binary masks that accurately separate defect pixels from normal PCB.
    * **Contrast Enhancement:** Implemented CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) preprocessing to improve defect visibility in low-contrast regions before applying thresholding.

## October 19, 2025

* **Objective:** Learned to clean and refine the initial "Difference Map" from the subtraction step.
* **Key Learnings:**
    * **Thresholding:** Applied Otsu's Thresholding to convert the grayscale map into a clean black-and-white (binary) image.
    * **Filtering:** Used Morphological Operations to remove noise and produce a "Final Cleaned Mask."
    * **Debugging:** Realized the importance of restarting the Colab session to clear old variables and always verifying file paths.

## October 18, 2025

* **Objective:** Set up the initial image processing pipeline.
* **Key Learnings:**
    * Set up the project in Google Colab and loaded the dataset.
    * Wrote a function to align a test image with a template.
    * Performed image subtraction to create a "Difference Map" and find potential defects.
