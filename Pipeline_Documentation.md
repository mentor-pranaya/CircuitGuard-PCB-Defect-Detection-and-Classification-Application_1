* **Objective:** Learned to clean and refine the initial "Difference Map" from the subtraction step.
* **Key Learnings:**
    * **Thresholding:** Applied Otsu's Thresholding to convert the grayscale map into a clean black-and-white (binary) image.
    * **Filtering:** Used Morphological Operations to remove noise and produce a "Final Cleaned Mask."
    * **Debugging:** Realized the importance of restarting the Colab session to clear old variables and always verifying file paths.
