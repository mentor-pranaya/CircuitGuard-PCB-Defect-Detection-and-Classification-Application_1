A polished Streamlit interface was created with a custom enterprise-style dark theme, supporting direct image upload and side-by-side result visualization.

Key Work Done

Designed app.py with modern UI styling (custom fonts, color gradients, responsive layout).

Added drag-and-drop upload fields with validation.

Implemented a two-column display for raw input vs. analysis output.

Built a custom PASS/DEFECT result card with confidence indicators.

Ensured compatibility across Streamlit versions with a stable image renderer.

Deliverables

Fully operational frontend interface.

Real-time visualization of defects and model confidence after analysis.
