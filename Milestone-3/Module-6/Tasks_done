A reliable Python backend was built to handle the full inference workflow for PCB defect detection using EfficientNet-B4. It preprocesses images, runs predictions, and outputs annotated results for the frontend.

Key Work Done

Modularized the image pipeline in backend_inference.py.

Added preprocess_image() for resizing, tensor conversion, and correct scaling (fixing the “black input” issue).

Integrated EfficientNet-B4 with dynamic checkpoint loading and automatic GPU/CPU selection.

Connected the backend with the frontend’s uploaded images.

Outputs prediction class, confidence, full probability distribution, and annotated images.

Deliverables

Fully functional backend inference script.

Complete prediction pipeline with bounding-box visualization.
