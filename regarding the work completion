Week 1 – Dataset Setup & Initial Image Processing

a] Set up the DeepPCB dataset and explored its structure.
b] Implemented template–test alignment and performed image subtraction, Otsu thresholding, and basic morphological filtering to generate clean defect masks.

Week 2 – Contour Detection & ROI Extraction

a] Developed an ROI extraction pipeline using OpenCV contour detection.
b] Extracted bounding boxes, cropped defect regions, and generated labeled samples for model training.
c] Verified bounding box quality visually.

Week 3 – EfficientNet Model Training

a] Implemented EfficientNet (CPU-optimized) and trained it on all defect classes. 
b] Preprocessed ROIs to 128×128, applied augmentations, and trained using Adam/CE-loss. 
c] Logged accuracy, loss, and model checkpoints.

Week 4 – Model Evaluation & Inference Testing

a] Tested the trained model using unseen images and validated predictions.
b] Generated annotated output images, prediction logs, and confusion matrix. 
c] Evaluated model performance on all defect categories.

Week 5 – Frontend (Streamlit) Development

a] Created a Streamlit web interface (app.py) for uploading template & test images.
b] Displayed annotated predictions, bounding boxes, and confidence scores.
c] Ensured real-time response and UI usability.

Week 6 – Backend Inference Pipeline

a] Modularized the entire processing pipeline inside module06_backend.py, integrating preprocessing, ROI extraction, EfficientNet inference, and annotation generation.
b] Connected backend with the Streamlit UI.

Week 7 – Testing, Optimization & Export Features

a] Performed end-to-end testing on full dataset batches.
b] Added export options including CSV logs and annotated images. 
c] Optimized image processing pipeline for faster CPU inference.

Week 8 – Final Documentation & Presentation Prep

a] Completed README, module-wise documentation, and final evaluation results.
b] Organized GitHub repository.
