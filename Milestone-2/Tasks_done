1. Summary
The objective of Milestone 2 was to develop, train, and validate a deep learning model capable of classifying printed circuit board (PCB) defects into six distinct categories. Using the ROI images generated in Milestone 1, an EfficientNet-B0 model was trained and achieved an accuracy of 96.53%, surpassing the project requirement of 94%.

2. Phase 1: Model Training (Module 3)
Objective: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize PCB defect patterns.

Training Pipeline:

Data Split: 80% training, 20% validation.

Augmentation: Random rotations, horizontal flips, and color jitter were applied to reduce overfitting.

Hyperparameters:

20 epochs

Adam optimizer (lr = 1e-4)

Cross-Entropy Loss

Outcome:
The model showed stable convergence, with validation accuracy stabilizing in the final epochs.
The best-performing weights were stored as best_efficientnet_b0.pth.

3. Phase 2: Evaluation & Testing (Module 4)
Objective: Evaluate the trained model on a separate, unseen test dataset to assess real-world performance.

Inference Setup:

Test Data: 634 images selected using stratified sampling from a dataset of 3,168 images.

Speed: Achieved ~2.09 iterations/second on GPU.

Performance Metrics:

Overall Accuracy: 96.53%

Class-wise Precision:

Missing_hole: 100%

Short: 99%

Spur: 90% 

Error Analysis:

Total Misclassifications: 22 out of 634 images (3.47% error rate).

Common Confusions: “Spurious_copper” and “Spur” were occasionally mixed due to similar visual patterns.
