Hello Ma'am 👋

I have successfully completed Milestone 2, Module 6: Backend Pipeline for Image Inference this week.

Key Steps and Deliverables:

-- Backend Image Inference Pipeline:
Implemented a complete backend pipeline that processes full PCB images and performs defect classification using the trained EfficientNet-B4 model.

-- Model Integration:
Integrated the EfficientNet-B4 checkpoint (trained in Module-3) into the backend system with strict state-dict loading to ensure correct predictions.

-- Pre-processing & Prediction Logic:
Added image preprocessing, softmax probability computation, and Top-1 + Top-2 defect prediction to improve clarity and reliability of outputs.

-- Annotated Output Generation:
Implemented automatic creation of annotated PCB images displaying predicted defect types along with confidence scores.

-- Batch Inference + Logging:
Enabled inference on multiple test images at once and generated a consolidated CSV log file with prediction results.

-- Web-Based UI (Streamlit):
Built a simple and interactive web interface where users can upload PCB images and instantly see:

Predicted defect class

Confidence score

Top-2 probabilities

Annotated result image

Downloadable logs and output images

-- Smooth Execution & Usability:
Ensured minimal lag, clean UI flow, and clear visualization, making the system ready for practical demonstration.
