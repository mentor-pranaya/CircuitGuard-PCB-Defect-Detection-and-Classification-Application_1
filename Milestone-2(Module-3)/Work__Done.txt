Hello Ma'am ðŸ‘‹

I have successfully completed Milestone 2, Module 3: EfficientNet Model Training this week.

Key Steps and Deliverables:

  --PyTorch Setup and Training: Set up the PyTorch environment and ran the training loop for the EfficientNet-B4 model using prepared 128Ã—128 defect images.
  --Model Building: Successfully built and trained the EfficientNet-B4 architecture to learn features from the defect dataset.
  --Performance Validation: The validation accuracy rapidly increased during training and meets/exceeds the â‰¥97% accuracy target.
  --Model Saving: Generated and saved the file best_efficientnet_b4.pth, which contains the model weights for defect classification.

This module created the application's "brain"â€”the trained model file that will be used for classifying defects in the final deployment stage later.
