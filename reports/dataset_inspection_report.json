Add comprehensive dataset inspection and processing reports documenting the complete image preprocessing pipeline. The dataset inspection report provides statistics for 693 PCB test images across 6 defect categories (Short, Spur, open, mouse_bite, spurious, missing_hole). The processing report contains batch execution results including success rates, Otsu threshold values, and mean pixel differences for quality verification of the alignment and thresholding pipeline.
