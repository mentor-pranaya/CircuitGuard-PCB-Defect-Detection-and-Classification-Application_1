The final module adds robust export features, session-based logging, and performance optimizations. Users can now run multiple scans, review results, and download both annotated images and session-wide reports. The inference pipeline was also optimized to avoid unnecessary recomputation.

Key Work Done

Added downloadable annotated images directly after each analysis.

Implemented session history logging (timestamp, filename, predicted defect, confidence).

Enabled CSV export of the complete session log for external analysis.

Optimized performance using Streamlit’s caching to load the model only once.

Enabled smooth multi-image evaluation with persistent session logs.

Deliverables

Downloadable annotated images and full session report.

Faster, more efficient inference pipeline with caching.

Stable multi-image testing workflow supporting cumulative evaluation.
