Hello Mam'm ðŸ‘‹,
  My work today involved implementing 
  a template-matching approach for PCB 
  defect detection using two test images.
  I used ORB to register (align) the defective image to the reference image,
  followed by image subtraction and Otsu's thresholding to generate the final defect mask.ðŸ˜Š
