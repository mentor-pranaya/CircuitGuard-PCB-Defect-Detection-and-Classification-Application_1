11-11-2025
Today, I have added upload fields to the frontend, enabling users to upload both template and test PCB images directly through the interface.

12-11-2025
Today, I have worked on displaying the uploaded images on the UI and prepared placeholders for showing output images with bounding boxes and defect labels.

13-11-2025
Today, I have implemented the visual output section in the frontend to ensure that annotated images can be rendered clearly and consistently after prediction.

14-11-2025
Today, I have finalized the Streamlit-based frontend, ensuring responsiveness, smooth rendering, and proper integration of all UI components for image upload and preview.

16-11-2025
Today, I have started modularizing the backend pipeline by separating image preprocessing, model loading, and inference functions into clean modules.

17-11-2025
Today, I have integrated the EfficientNet-B4 trained model checkpoint into the backend and verified that the model loads correctly for inference.

18-11-2025
Today, I have connected the backend inference pipeline with the frontend upload inputs, enabling real-time processing of user-submitted images.

19-11-2025
Today, I have implemented the generation of annotated images in the backend, adding bounding boxes and labels to the defect regions detected by the model.

20-11-2025
Today, I have optimized the backend pipeline to reduce processing time and ensured that annotated outputs and logs are returned smoothly to the UI.

21-11-2025
Today, I have tested the complete frontend–backend workflow, confirming that uploaded images are processed with minimal lag and results are displayed correctly.

24-11-2025
Today, I have added the feature to download labeled output images and prediction logs directly from the UI for user convenience.

25-11-2025
