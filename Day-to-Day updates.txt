Hello Mam'm,

15-10-2025 
Today, I have downloaded the PCB dataset and understood the data present in it.

17-10-2025
Today, I have reviewed the PCB dataset and understood the various types of defects present in multipule different kind of PCB boards.

18-10-2025
Today, I have done the preprocessing of the PCB dataset by alinging the given models.

21-10-2025
Today, I have done the code compares of defect images to golden images, detects visual differences, processes the result using image operations, and saves binary defect masks for each image.

22-10-2025
Today, I have done loading mask images, detecting defect contours using OpenCV, and visualizing them to verify the defect regions clearly and accurately.

23-10-2025
Today, I have generated Regions of Interest (ROI) from the binary defect masks obtained in Module 2 and extracted individual defect patches from PCB images.

24-10-2025
Today, I have organized the extracted ROI images into separate folders according to defect types and ensured correct labeling of each defect category.

28-10-2025
Today, I have merged minor defect subfolders into main defect categories to simplify the dataset, resulting in a clean folder structure ready for training in Module 3.

29-10-2025
Today, I have implemented EfficientNet-B4 in PyTorch and prepared the model architecture for training on the ROI dataset.

30-10-2025
Today, I have performed data augmentation and preprocessing on the ROI images to improve model robustness and ensure uniform input size for EfficientNet-B4.

31-10-2025
Today, I have set up the training pipeline using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss, and started initial training on the prepared dataset.

01-11-2025
Today, I have monitored training progress, adjusted hyperparameters for better convergence, and logged accuracy and loss metrics during each epoch.

04-11-2025
Today, I have completed the EfficientNet-B4 model training, saved the best-performing model checkpoint, and generated training plots for accuracy and loss.

05-11-2025
Today, I have evaluated the trained model on the test set, calculated classification accuracy, and visualized results with confusion matrices and other evaluation plots.

06-11-2025
Today, I have analyzed model performance across different defect categories, identified areas of improvement, and ensured repeatable training results with stable accuracy.

07-11-2025
Today, I have exported the trained EfficientNet-B4 model along with evaluation metrics and plots, making it ready for deployment or further inference on a different machine.
